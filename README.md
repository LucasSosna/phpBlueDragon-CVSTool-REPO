# phpBlueDragon CVSTool

No more problems with CSV files
You will generate the content of CSV files immediately in the form of a table both on the server and on the local computer.
- Each line should contain a separate line
- Each row should contain the same number of columns
- The file will be converted into a table using the <table> tag.
